[The Last Algorithm Course You'll Ever Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/introduction/) -  ThePrimeagen introduces the course by discussing some personal background with algorithms, types of algorithms that will be covered, and suggestions for retaining the information presented in this course. Reasons to learn algorithms, why this course uses TypeScript, and ThePrimeagen's social media links are also provided in this lesson.

[Algorithms Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/?ref=shm) Comprehensive overview of basic to moderate algorithms and patterns with examples and practice problems. 

[Advanced Data Structures](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/?ref=shm) Data Structures are used to store and manage data in an efficient and organised way for faster and easy access and modification of Data. Some of the basic data structures are Arrays, LinkedList, Stacks, Queues etc. This page will contain some of the complex and advanced Data Structures like Disjoint Sets, Self-Balancing Trees, Segment Trees, Tries etc.

# Practice

[Leet Code - Top 150 Interview Questions](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/) - For these questions, I like to mainly focus on the easy/medium, as you are far more likely to receive a question similar to this difficulty in the actual interview.
