Welcome to the Job Search Repository! This repository is designed to be a comprehensive resource for job seekers in the field of computer science and software engineering. Whether you're preparing for algorithm interviews, looking for general job search resources, or diving into system design interviews, you'll find valuable information and tools here.

## Algorithm Interviews
In this section, you'll find resources to help you prepare for algorithmic interviews. We've organized the content to cover a wide range of topics to enhance your problem-solving skills.

## General Resources
Job searching involves more than just technical interviews. This section provides resources to assist you in various aspects of the job search process, from resume building to behavioral interviews.

## System Design Interviews
System design interviews are a critical aspect of many technical interviews, especially for senior roles. This section provides resources to help you understand and excel in system design discussions.

Feel free to contribute by adding more resources, sharing your experiences, or suggesting improvements. Happy job hunting!


## NOTE
I would advise, almost as much or more than just studying/practicing problems, is to really focus on studying TIME/SPACE Complexity. This is vital to displaying complete understanding of the concepts and approaches used in your algorithms. Nailing a problem and not understanding why it is or isn't efficient can break you -- Treat these interviews like doing your math homework in school -- the teacher cares more about the process and the understanding than just the right answer. Approach every problem with process and rigor:
1) Start with what's given, note the inputs and outputs
2) Talk (even to yourself) through a basic approach -- dont prematurely optimize
3) Solve the problem first, work in psuedo code, and talk through each step as you test
4) Coding should come last after you have most of a solution -- you can start step 3 at coding, just dont get bogged down in testing/fighting syntax if you dont have the answer.
5) Can you make it better? Now you can try to optimize, talk through what is inefficient as you iterate and improve.
6) Explain the time and space complexity for your approach.
