[Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) - Learn how to uncover the hints and hidden details in a question, discover how to break down a problem into manageable chunks, develop techniques to unstick yourself when stuck, learn (or re-learn) core computer science concepts, and practice on 189 interview questions and solutions.  
  
These interview questions are real; they are not pulled out of computer science textbooks. They reflect what's truly being asked at the top companies, so that you can be as prepared as possible.

A great book for learning the overall process and teaching you how to study for and ace each section of the interview. I found this book particularly helpful for the behavioral section of the interview process. *HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.* 

[Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844) - This is a beefy book. Not needed at all for the interview process, but it is great for algorithm references.
