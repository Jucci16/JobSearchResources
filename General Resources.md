# Books
[Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) - A great book for learning the overall process and teaching you how to study for and ace each section of the interview. I found this book particularly helpful for the behavioral section of the interview process. *HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.* 

[Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844) - This is a beefy book. Not needed at all for the interview process, but it is great for algorithm references.
